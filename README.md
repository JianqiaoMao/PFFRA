# PFFRA: Permutation Feature-based Frequency Response Analysis
PFFRA: An Interpretable Machine Learning technique to analyse the contribution of features in the frequency domain. This method is inspired by permutation feature importance analysis but aims to quantify and analyse the time-series predictive model's mechanism from a global perspective.

## Background

### Feature Importance Analysis

It is important to understand and disclose the most important features that contribute to the predictions through a reasonable measuring scheme, because this knowledge can help machine learning engineers improve model transparency and reveal unwanted behaviours [1].
